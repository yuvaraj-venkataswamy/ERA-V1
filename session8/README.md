# SESSION 8 - BATCH NORMALIZATION & REGULARIZATION - Assignment

## Objective
- Change the dataset to CIFAR10
- Make this network:
  - C1 C2 c3 P1 C3 C4 C5 c6 P2 C7 C8 C9 GAP C10
  - Keep the parameter count less than 50000
  - Try and add one layer to another
  - Max Epochs is 20
- You are making 3 versions of the above code (in each case achieve above 70% accuracy):
  - Network with Group Normalization
  - Network with Layer Normalization
  - Network with Batch Normalization
- Share these details
  - Training accuracy for 3 models
  - Test accuracy for 3 models
  - Find 10 misclassified images for the BN model, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images.
